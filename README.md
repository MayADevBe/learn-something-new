# LearnSomethingNew

Want to learn something new? But don't know what? This small project is for exactly this situation. It will give you a random suggestion - maybe even something that will suprise/interest you.

## Usage

Just click the button, select the categories you are interested in, the time you want to spend learning and how much money you are willing to spend.
Keep in mind that these might be very subjective and can vary depending on how serious you want to be about learning.

## There is a skill missing?

You noticed that there is something missing that people should definitly learn, let me know!

You can:

- write me an email or on twitter
- open an issue
- make a pull request
  (When making a pull request please make sure that you edited all the json files (in the asset folder) as necessary. Try to avoid adding unecessary new tags for categories, money and times. The structure for the skills is as follows: `[ "skill",["category1", "category2"],["time1", "time2],["money1"],"description","resources" ]`)
